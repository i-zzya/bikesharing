# Bikesharing

## Overview

We were tasked to help investors understand that a Bike-Sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business. With that being said we had to create a bike trip analysis using Tableau. Specifically looking for length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
